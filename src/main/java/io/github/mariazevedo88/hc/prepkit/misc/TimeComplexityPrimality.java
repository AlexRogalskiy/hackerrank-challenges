/**
 * A prime is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. Given p integers, 
 * determine the primality of each integer and print whether it is Prime or Not prime on a new line.
 * 
 * Note: If possible, try to come up with an O(âˆšn) primality algorithm, or see what sort of optimizations you can come 
 * up with for an O(n) algorithm. Be sure to check out the Editorial after submitting your code!
 * 
 * Function Description
 * 
 * Complete the primality function in the editor below. It should return Prime if n is prime, or Not prime.
 * 
 * primality has the following parameter(s):
 * n: an integer to test for primality
 * 
 * Input Format
 * 
 * The first line contains an integer, p, denoting the number of integers to check for primality.
 * Each of the p subsequent lines contains an integer, n, the number you must test for primality.
 * 
 * Constraints
 * 
 * 1 <= p <= 30
 * 2 <= n <= 2x10^9
 * 
 * Output Format
 * 
 * For each integer, print whether n is Prime or Not prime on a new line.
 * 
 * Sample Input
 * 
 * 3
 * 12
 * 5
 * 7
 * 
 * Sample Output
 * 
 * Not prime
 * Prime
 * Prime
 * 
 * Explanation
 * 
 * We check the following p=3 integers for primality:
 * 1. n = 12 is divisible by numbers other than 1 and itself (i.e.: 2,3,4,6), so we print Not prime on a new line.
 * 2. n = 5 is only divisible 1 and itself, so we print Prime on a new line.
 * 3. n = 7 is only divisible 1 and itself, so we print Prime on a new line.
